            <p> eiclock.com is a one day clock. It maps the 24 hours of a day on a unit circle using euler's identity.
            </p>
            e^i2pi = 1 day

            <p>This is an animation of a 1 full day.</p>

            {{ Insert animation here }}

            <p>The day can start at an time you want. The default is 7:00 am, like Elon [1].
                The day is split into 4 quarters, each is 6 hours, with 1 quarter dedicated to sleep, like Elon. He has
                around 6 hours sleep a day [2].</p>

            <p>Each of the remaing 3 quarters is split in 3 sectors, every sector is 2 hours long. And
                each sector is split in 24 blocks, each block is 5 minutes long, again like Elon.</p>

            <p>Put all the above together, you get a 1 dat clock with a default configuration ( call it Elon
                configuration) That
                give you a visual view of your day. With the time passed the time remaining and also remaing blocks in
                the current sector.</p>

            {{ Insert the clock here}}
