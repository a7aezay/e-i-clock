# The Euler Clock (e^i = 1 Day) [DRAFT IN PROGRESS]

The idea was triggered by this question. If I want to break the clock...how can I break it.

First thing come come to mind is the rotation direction...why clock rotates this direction instead of the opposite.

I wondered if the reason cause this is how the earth rotate around it self. but turned out no. the earth rotates in the counter-clock wise direction. Not only that but also the earth rotates around the sun , the electorn around the nucluse. the solar system around the galaxy. 

Given these it seemed just natrual to me to think of the clock in this direction. 

Elon Configuration


The euler clock has a default configuration called elon configuration. Which divides the day to 5 min blocks.
