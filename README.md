# Euler's Identity Clock

This is an animation of a 1 full day.

{{ Insert animation here }}

The day can start at an time you want. The default is 7:00 am, like Elon [1].
The day is split into 4 quarters, each is 6 hours, with 1 quarter dedicated to sleep, like Elon. He has around 6 hours sleep a day [2].

Each of the remaing 3 quarters is split in 3 sectors, every sector is 2 hours long. And
each sector is split in 24 blocks, each block is 5 minutes long, again like Elon.

Put all the above together, you get a 1 dat clock with a default configuration ( call it Elon configuration) That
give you a visual view of your day. With the time passed the time remaining and also remaing blocks in the current sector.
